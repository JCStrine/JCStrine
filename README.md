My name is Jordan Strine, I am a full stack web applications developer with a focus on Vue.js applications. My passion projects focus around creating tools that assist in day to day work processs, or just creating a bot that people enjoy interacting with.

I'm currently building up my knowledge in languages other than javascript, such as C++ and Java.
